Analyze code implementation details. Focus on WHAT technologies/techniques are used and what are NOT used.

Identify:
- Specific libraries, frameworks, APIs
- Modern techniques present or absent
- Implementation approach
- Architectural patterns

Be technical and specific. Note absences of modern techniques.
